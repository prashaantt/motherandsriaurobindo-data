"THE greatness of a person is the greatness of the Impersonal in him. He has little concern about himself. His thoughts, feelings and acts are in relation to a wider frame of reference. The wider the frame, the higher the status of the being; there is an ascending scale in the structure of human life and society. There are gradations that mount from narrower ranges, moving towards vaster and vaster ranges, taking the person into greater and purer degrees of impersonality. We start, for example, from the lowest and narrowest range, namely, the family, and extend ourselves more and more to the next range, the nation, then to mankind and then still farther to transcendent ranges.

Sri Aurobindo from his very birth was such an impersonal personality–and, in the very highest sense. He had never the consciousness of a particular individual person: all reference to a personal frame of his was deleted from the texture of his nature and character. There was some reference to the family frame in a very moderate way, almost casually: the stress was much more on the next higher frame, the national. In its time the national frame was very strong and played a great part; and yet even there it was not an end in itself, the frame of humanity always loomed large behind. In fact it was that that gave a greater and truer value and significance to the national frame. The national is but a ladder to humanity, it is a unit in the human collectivity. It serves as a channel for international and global welfare, but there is yet a still larger frame, the frame of the spirit, the transcendent consciousness. Indeed it was this that lay at the bottom of Sri Aurobindo's consciousness as the bedrock of his being which gave the whole tone and temper of his life, its meaning and purpose. Even when not overt and patent this noumenal personality was always there insistent from behind; it gave a peculiar rhythm and stress, newness and freshness and a profound element of purposefulness to the whole life, even to the activities of the earlier and narrower frames. For it was like viewing everything through the eyes of infinity and eternity, the eye wide extended in heaven as the Vedic Rishi says, the third eye.

In other words, the yogi, the Divine, the Impersonal man in Sri Aurobindo was the real person always there from the very birth. Thus we see him starting life exactly with the thing where every one ends. In his inner being he had not to pass through the gradations that lead an ordinary person gradually towards the widening ranges of consciousness and existence. In all the stations of his life, in every sphere and status Sri Aurobindo was doing his duties, that is, his work – kartavyam karma – selflessly, which means with no sense of self, or perhaps we should say, with supreme Selfhoodness; for such is the character, the very nature of the born yogi, the Godman. The duties done for and within a frame of life tend always to overflow, as it were, the boundaries and do not always strictly follow the norm of the limited frame. For example, even while in the family life, in the midst of relatives and close friends he was never moved by mere attachment or worldly ties, he was impelled to do what he had to in the circumstances, unattached, free, under another command. Again, when he chose the larger field of national life, here too, he was not limited to that frame, his patriotism was not chauvinism or a return to the parochialism of the past; his patriotism was broad-based upon the sense of human solidarity and even the broad-based humanity was not broad enough for the consciousness in him; for humanity does not mean mere humanitarianism, charity, benevolence, or service to mankind. True humanity can be or is to be reached by pushing it still farther into the Divinity where men are not merely brothers or even portions of the Divine but one with Him, the self-same being and personality. 

Thus, Sri Aurobindo was an ideal worker, the perfect workman doing the work appropriate to the field of work according to its norm, faultless in execution. As a family man, as a citizen, as a patriot, he carried out his appointed function not in any personal sense with the feeling or consciousness of any individual personality but a large impersonal personality free from ego-sense which is the hallmark of a luminous cosmic consciousness, based upon a still higher and transcendent standing.

Sri Aurobindo was a man of action absolutely in the Gita's sense of the word. He set an example, he was an exemplar showing by his life his way of \"standing and walking\" as the Gita puts it – the actions that should be done and the way of doing according to the stage and the field given to oneself. This does not naturally mean that one has to be bound to the current frame, bound to the conventional, attached to what is customary, transitional and formal; on the contrary as I have said, Sri Aurobindo in his stride was always transgressing and overflowing the borders, he was a revolutionary, even an iconoclast, for nothing short of the supreme and complete and integral truth satisfied the urge of consciousness in him; in this sense each step of the scale served as a jumping board to the higher, indeed to the highest inherent or hidden in every one of them.

It was this secret ultimate truth that overshadowed, brooded over all these stages and steps and occupations he passed through: they only led up to that transcendent reality, but it was the sense, constant sense of that reality that lent a special character to all his karma. This. urge towards the supreme reality, this transcendence, did not mean for him a rejection of the domains passed through: it is a subsuming, that is to say, uplifting the narrower, the lower status, integrating them into the higher: even as the soil at the root of the plant is subsumed and transmuted into the living sap that mounts high up the plant towards its very top, to the light and energy above.
   
In the scheme and pattern of human existence in the hierarchy that is collective life, Sri Aurobindo sought to express the play of the supreme Truth, express materially that which works always in secret and behind the veil. The Supreme Reality is not merely the supreme awareness and consciousness, but it is a power and a force; and it holds still a secret source that has not yet been touched, – touched consciously by the human consciousness and utilised for world existence. Man's genius has contacted today in the material world material forces which are almost immaterial – the extra-galactic radiation, the laser beams and other energies of that category which are powerful in an unbelievable unheard of 'degree. Even so in the consciousness, there is a mode of force which is not only a force that knows but creates, not only creates but transforms. That force at its intrinsic optimum can enter into dull matter and transforming it, transform into radiant matter, radiant not only with the physical, the solar light but the light of the supreme Spirit.

This is the force which Sri Aurobindo has disclosed and put at the disposal of mankind. This is the force he has set free that is creating a new world,–reorganising and remoulding, through a great travail indeed, our ancient sphere that will cradle the earth of the golden age."

"In Sri Aurobindo particularly the impersonalisation is in reality a re-personalisation. Impersonalisation need not mean de-personalisation, that is to say, a complete negation and annihilation of all personality: impersonalisation really means the negation of the ego or rather the replacement of the ego by the true person, the ego being only a deformation or degradation. The basic ego-sense lies in the individual; but it has its formations in the collectivity also at all the different degrees and levels of consciousness. We have spoken of the mounting frames of reference, and accordingly there is a family ego, a national ego and even there is a humanity ego. The collective ego is as strong as the individual ego. It is only in the transcendent consciousness, the consciousness of the Divine who is the one true Person, that the inferior egos are eliminated or sublimated and can find their true person.

Thus the true process of impersonalisation is re-personalisation; in other words, to be conscious of, to grow into and become the true reality of the being behind the ego formation. I t means divinisation of the person. The individual divinises himself into the individual Divine and then around him, first of all, in his inner consciousness, the frame or field changes also into a divine structure. Thus even the family for such a consciousness changes not only its connotation but even its denotation. We may in this connection remember Christ's words with regard to his true family. The nation too assumes its Divine reality, a transcendent personality appears as an expression of the Divine afflatus, each one a particular mode of fulfilling the cosmic purpose. Humanity too undergoes a sea-change and its personality attains a glorious stature in the sahasra-shirsha Purusha as hymned by the Vedic Rishi.

This is the cosmos that Sri Aurobindo has expressed, created in his consciousness and therefore in the consciousness of the cosmos itself. This transcendent formation the future is holding ready-made in the womb of the World-Purusha (or rather World-Prakriti) and the day is approaching when this new creation will manifest itself upon earth. The true truth of things is always there up somewhere in the Supreme – in the Parabrahman – from time sempiternal: the question is when and how to bring it down. He who does that is the Avatara, he who comes down and embodies it.

To recapitulate: Impersonalisation involves or culminates in divinisation which means the descent of the Divine, the supreme Person, from above or His emergence from within (both mean the same thing), with the result that all other inferior or external formulations are subsumed, integrated into the supreme Reality forming one single body and personality.
    
Such is the content of Sri Aurobindo’s consciousness, such is the work that is being pursued under the stress of that consciousness towards the realisation of a new, a divine world.
    
We end as we began, only giving a positive turn to what we said: the greatness of the Great is the greatness of the Divine in him.
    
In conclusion, here is, in his own words, what he stood for and worked for, what he promises for the future of earth and mankind:

>All then shall change, a magic order come
>Overtopping this mechanical universe.
>A mightier race shall inhabit the mortal’s world. 
>On Nature's luminous tops, on the Spirit’s ground,
>The superman shall reign as king of life,
>Make earth almost the mate and peer of heaven
>And lead towards God and truth man’s ignorant heart
>And lift towards godhead his mortality.
        
>Nature shall live to manifest secret God,
>The Spirit shall take up the human play,
>This earthly life become the life divine.[^1]

"I PROPOSE to speak to you on a very interesting subject – about Sri Aurobindo. You know it is his centenary, that is to say, this August[^2] he completes a hundred years of earthly existence: I say earthly advisedly because although he has left his body he has not left earth's atmosphere. The Mother assures us he will be there to see the work begun be completed. I will speak on a very peculiar aspect of Sri Aurobindo's life. Many must have noticed it but I wish to draw your particular attention to it. Sri Aurobindo's life is an extraordinary phenomenon. It is not that of an ordinary human being. The life of an ordinary man follows a well-marked line of development, almost a routine good for everybody. The pattern is familiar, you can even foresee and foretell the future – and the destiny of a person. You start as a student, join a school, go up to the college, after passing out you choose a profession, become an engineer or doctor or businessman or something well-recognised like that, then you continue to stick to the job you have chosen: you become a rich man or if you are unfortunate a poor man, anyhow go through the experiences of the life allotted to you, you become old, have children, grandchildren and then pass away; that is the ordinary course of life. In Sri Aurobindo life has a different line, movement and procedure. Strangely it consists of breaks, sudden unforeseen turns almost cutting away the past altogether. And then what is to be noted is that these breaks or turns are not imposed upon him but they are normally his own conscious decisions out of his own deliberate will, except one or two, I shall point out as I go on. These turns.however may not be always a right-about-turn but anyhow, I may say, a right turn, a turn to the right, always to the right – until the final ultimate Right is reached.

First of all – let us begin from the very beginning. The very first step or turn he took in his early childhood was in fact a complete about turn – the antipodes of what he was and where he was. For, he was almost uprooted from his normal surroundings and removed across far seas to a distant land. From out of an Indian Bengali family he was thrown into the midst of a British Christian family. He was made to forget his native language, his country's traditions, his people's customs and manners, he had to adopt an altogether different mode of life and thinking, a thoroughly Europeanised style and manner. Naturally being a baby this was an occasion, the earliest when he had not his choice, his own deliberate decision but had to follow the choice of his father – the choice perhaps of his secret soul and destiny. His father meant well, for he wanted his children to be not only good but great according to his conception of goodness and greatness. Now, in that epoch when the British were the masters of India and we their slaves, in those days the ideal for a person of intelligence and promise, the ideal of success was to become a high government official, a district magistrate or a district judge; that was the highest ambition of an Indian of that time and naturally Sri Aurobindo's parents and well-wishers thought of Sri Aurobindo in that line, he would become a very famous district magistrate or a Commissioner even, the highest position that an Indian could achieve. So he had to appear at an examination for that purpose, it was called – those glittering letters to Indian eyes: I.C.S. (Indian Civil Service). Now here was the very first deliberate choice of his own, the first radical turn he took – to cut himself away from the normally developing past. He turned away from that line of growth and his life moved on to a different scale. His parents and friends were mortified such a brilliant boy come to nought but he had pushed away the past as another vision allured him and he stuck to his decision.

Next as you all know, he came to Baroda, entered the State service – as Secretary to the Maharaja and professor of the College. That life was also externally a very normal and ordinary life – an obscure life, so to say, but he preferred obscurity for the sake of his inner development and growth. Still he continued in that obscure position that was practically what we call the life of a clerk. He continued it for sometime, although sometime meant twelve years, the same length as his previous stage. Then a moment came when he changed all that. Another volte-face. If he continued he might have advanced, progressed in his career, that is to say, become Principal of the College, even the Dewan of Baroda, a very lofty position, a very lofty position indeed for an Indian, become another R. C. Dutt. But he threw all that overboard, wiped off the twelve years of his youthful life and came to Bengal as a national leader, a leader of the new movement that wanted freedom for India, freedom from the domination of Britain. He jumped into this dangerous life – the uncertain life of a servant of the country, practically without a home, without resources of his own. He ran the risk of being caught by the British, put into prison or shot or hanged even but he chose that life. That was a great decision he took, a turn about entirely changing the whole mode of his life. Eventually as a natural and inevitable result of his political .activities he was arrested by the British and put into prison. He had to pass a whole year in the prison. And this led to another break from the past, ushering in quite another way of life. The course of his life turned inward and moved from depth to depth.

In the prison one incident happened which is not known to many but extremely important and of great consequence. I have mentioned it in my *Reminiscences*.[^3] When we were in prison we thought – we were the first batch of political prisoners accused of conspiracy and practically of rebellion *against the established government – so* we thought this was the end of our life's journey. One day we will be taken out and shot: court trial and justice was a make-believe and sham. Or if we were lucky enough we would be exiled to the Andamans – the notorious *kalapani*. So a few of our leaders in the prison who were elders to us thought of escape from the prison-make a dash, break out, scale the walls, out in the open. There were plannings with outside helpers. When the plan was a little matured, our elders thought of consulting Sri Aurobindo. Without his Consent naturally nothing could be done. For he was the one leader and guide. So when Sri Aurobindo was informed of the plan he said bluntly: I am not going to do anything of the kind. I stand the trial. As a natural consequence the project fell through and very fortunately for us. It is true he already knew the result of the case, that is that he would be freed and nothing would happen to him. Still at that time there was a suspense and we all were in doubt. This decision of Sri Aurobindo was another, I may say, great turn of his life. If he had accepted the prospect his life and destiny would have been different, we all would have been massacred. In other words he saved his life for his spiritual work.

On coming out he engaged himself again in the national work, the British were truly perturbed and worried because they knew here was *the* man, the source of all mischief. They did not know how to control and get at him. So they thought of arresting him again and deport him, send him out of bounds – outside India, to Burma or some such far off place. In the meanwhile he continued to do his work as usual, editing two papers, seeing and advising people, going out on lecturing tours etc. But it was time for the next break or turn. One day-one night, that is to say – all of a sudden he said, he would go to an unknown destination and literally he did so, dropped and left things as they were and disappeared. People knew later on that he had gone to Pondicherry. This time it was almost literally wiping out the past. He started an altogether new life, inner and outer. Here started directly his climb to the Supramental. Here too after a few years came an occasion when he had to take another radical decision. One more turn to the right – to the more, yet more right.

The British could not tolerate his existence, his safe existence in India, even though in (the then) French India. They felt themselves unsafe, for they felt this man could do anything. As France was an ally to the British, there was an *entente cordiale*, so they both came to an understanding and made a proposal to Sri Aurobindo: France would gladly receive Sri Aurobindo in their midst, give him safe shelter and quiet circumstances to pursue his spiritual life. France was ready to offer Sri Aurobindo a house, a home in Algeria. Here too Sri Aurobindo answered with a clear and definite No. He said he would stick to the place he had chosen. Sri Aurobindo had some friends and companions who also took shelter in the French territory. They would have liked to accept the proposal to escape from the constant British persecution. But Sri Aurobindo's decision came as a disappointment to them, but they had to acquiesce. Now, at this distance of time we can see all the import of his formidable decision half a century ago.

There was yet one more crisis, a great crisis – the fate of humanity and also his own destiny, the fate of his work depended upon it. The world was nearing the world-shaking war – the Second World War. It was the invasion of the asuric forces upon earth to destroy humanity and human civilisation and prevent the advent of that truth which Sri Aurobindo was preparing to bring down. Sri Aurobindo opposed that mighty onrush with his will and divine strength. He broke the hostile downward-speeding force by taking it into himself, even like god Shiva who swallowed poison and harboured it in his throat to release immortality for the Gods. The subtle attack left in him a bruised body and to man a saved world. He followed up his action by a whole-hearted support to the Allies in that war against those who were the instruments of the Hostiles.

We come finally now to the last act, the last decision that he took of an almost complete turn, a full cycle. It was his considerate deliberate decision to move out of the physical material scene and take his station just in the background from where he could move and direct things more effectively.

I have spoken of Sri Aurobindo's life as a series of radical turns that changed the movement, the mode of life, almost radically every time the turn came. The turn meant a break with the past and a moving into the future. We have a word for this phenomenon of radical and unforeseen change. You know the word, it is *intervention*. Intervention means, as the Mother has explained to us more than once, the entry of a higher, a greater force from another world into the already existent world. Into the familiar established mode of existence that runs on the routine of some definite rules and regulations, the Law of the present, there drops all on a sudden another mode of being and consciousness and force, a Higher Law which obliterates or changes out of recognition the familiar mode of living; it is thus that one rises from level to level, moves out into wider ranges of being, otherwise one stands still, remains for ever what he is, stagnant, like an unchanging clod or at the most a repetitive animal.

The higher the destiny, the higher also the source of intervention, that is to say, more radical – more destructive yet more creative – destructive of the past, creative of the future.

I have spoken of the passing away of Sri Aurobindo as a phenomenon of intervention, a great decisive event in view of the work to be done. Even so we may say that his birth too was an act of intervention, a deliberate divine intervention. The world needed it, the time was ripe and the intervention happened and that was his birth as an embodied human being – to which we offer our salutation and obeisance today.

The century salutes a divine birth and a death divine, ushering in a century of diviner moment.

"IT IS *Integration*. I am using a much used, much abused word but it happens to be *the* word. We have reached a status of consciousness within as distinct units, individual or collective: our effort should now be to co-ordinate, to harmonise the different and differing units or separate elements into a well-knit single whole. That means, the ego-centres that are still left and active are to be exorcised, purified – the separative knot has to be dissolved and the true centre of unity to be found – the psychic divine centre.

First each element in the individual, each level of his being must find its centre, its soul or psychic base – and then only a co-ordination of all would be possible. Next through the psychic level the general level of the being and consciousness, that is to say, its expression and its field of action should be lifted and raised to a higher potency of poise – the higher the better – towards the higher mind, towards the overmental – and beyond.

The Divine Presence in the heart – the central psychic – should not only be felt constantly there in the heart but in all other parts or levels of the being: it must create or awake its figure or norm everywhere so that it can inspire and control directly all activities and movements in a global and total gesture. It has to be an integral dynamic Presence, that is the way of uplifting the poise of the *adhara*, its global existence. The process is first to deepen the Presence, that is from the surface to dive into the inner realm and then float up again into a wider and higher expanse, deeper and deeper means truer and truer truth – nearer the pure fundamental reality – the Eternal and Infinite, the supreme Spirit, the bedrock of existence. Higher and higher means formulations of the Reality in a gradually evolving expansion up the ladders of the physical, the vital, the mental consciousness and towards the higher mental and overmental, indeed towards the Supramental."

"It is not sufficient that the central psychic being comes forward and exercises what is at most a general influence on the other limbs of the being. It should enter into its counter-parts or counter-points – the inherent psychic centres of each part and parcel and make them directly active. The central psychic – self – has its delegated selves everywhere in the global being. Indeed each particle of the being must itself be a psychic or psychicised particle: a consciousness-photon. There is thus a vital photon, a mental photon, a photon of the physical consciousness even as the material photon. And all these in their hierarchic harmonious arrangement shall constitute the global system of the new person.

Even so, there is to be a transmutation of the environment also: the outer objects and circumstances and happenings will be a field – an Einsteinian field – of modulations, pulsations, tensions, of these consciousness-particles of the psychic.

An uplift of consciousness is a natural consequence of the psychic's aspiration. The psychic has the power to call down the rain of higher existence, a wider law of being-higher means, as I have said, higher than the highest mental yet achieved by man normally and generally-stepping by the intermediary gradations towards the Supermind.

This, on the whole, is the inherent activity of the inferior or subordinate nature in its aspiration to move upward and transform itself. This activity in us all, it must be noted, is supported, initiated and inspired by the self-action of the higher nature, the descent of the above-mental regions. "

"The first definitive and distinctive higher status is that of the Overmind. Its character is a global and entire being and consciousness, a cosmic and universal all-inclusive existence. Each being attains its self and each self lives *in* every other self and all selves together and at the same time live *in* each self. The diversities are not abolished – as *in* the unitary consciousness and being of the absolute Existence, Brahman – variations  are maintained as the *multiple* aspects or modalities of the same single infinite eternal power.
 
I am now speaking here of *samrajya-siddhi*, the realisation of the world-empire, the spiritual or Divine Empire. First of course there is, as the basis of the *samrajya*, the *svarajya*, the kingdom or reign of the individual's own self. In effect, the world-empire or the imperial *reign* of the Spirit has three gradations. At the outset each element, that *is*, each individual human being (we limit ourselves to the human collectivity at present) has to attain *svarajya*, self-rule, a perfectly homogeneous integral spiritual whole in himself: then all such individuals should achieve integrality with one another. Each lives in and through every other and all together live in everyone. The whole forms an indissoluble integral and *unitary* life. This collective integration means all individuals have one mind, one vital being, even one physical consciousness, not of course one material body but still a feeling of the' kind. One mind or one vital or one physical consciousness does not mean everyone has the same identical formations and movements in these respective regions, but all possess substantially the same stuff belonging to a self-same unit. A comparison or analogy may explain and illustrate the point. For example, the different parts of a human body form one integrated texture: they are all bound up, united although not fused together, in an inextricable, \"inexorable\" unity. Action in one part creates a reaction, re-echoes or re-doubles in every other part: they all rise up like one man as it is popularly said, at a single touch. Different in form, different in function, they are identical in their substantial composition, in their fundamental stuff-the organic plasma; even so, the minds of all, their vital movements, their physical movements too, however different and diverse, contrary or contradictory, are in their own respective domains part and particles of the one and the same substance and all together contribute to form, to create a symphony, a grand Beethovenesque orchestra.

The next grade of integration in the Divine world-empire comes when not only individuals but groups and collectivities find and establish their own selves – each its *svarajya*, and all combined in a yet larger and greater organisation: combined and unified they act in a unified and homogeneous living as individuals do in the world aggregate. Although the individual is the basic reality, aggregations and collectivities also are realities, even spiritual realities in the progressive unfoldment of the cosmic spirit."

"Such a consummation, so complex in composition, so global in scope would be possible only when the above-mental or the overmental world-consciousness descends into the mental and lower hemisphere and takes possession of it and becomes active and dynamic there. The movement upward, the evolutionary force in nature inclusive of the human aspiration is the spearhead to break through the solid frontier wall of ignorance and inferior consciousness; the luminous point that breaks through is, as I have said, the soul-power, the psychic. That creates the rift in the dense covering through which can pour down the rains and streams of the universal consciousness with its purificatory ablution of the lower nature and conciousness. But this again becomes not only possible but inevitable when this new consciousness contacts openly and directly its master and overlord, the supreme Supramental Consciousness, which is the true reality pressing down always upon the lower creation, rejecting whatever has to be thrown out, sifting and screening the mixture, sublimating, subsuming all that has to be retained within itself.

The problem, the fundamental problem is not merely to extract the Truth out of its covering of falsehood-in the image of the Upanishads, to pull the inner stem out of its sheath. It is not sufficient to liberate the spirit from the obscuring matter but to instal the spirit in the body of matter and transfigure it into the substance of the Spirit, build it in its own image. It is not sufficient to arrive at the One without the second, the Unitary Unit, but to realise the Unit in its most concrete multiplicity.

To spiritualise Matter does not mean dematerialising Matter! It means rather re-materialising the Spirit. And that is the task of the Supermind and its intermediate and immediate helpers – agents and emissaries – the Overmind and Above-mind."

" The Supermind is of Course the last and ultimate or other wise the first and original Support and inspiration of all other levels of being and living. Apart from this fundamental, this one source of sustenance, each intermediary level depends directly and leans upon the one that lies just above it, over arches it as it were. Thus speaking of the major intermediaries, the Overmind is under the direct control and guidance of the over-arching Supermind. And Overmind itself over-arches, broods over the mind and from behind guides and controls it. The Mind has evolved primarily because of the pressure of the Overmind standing immediately above it in the hierarchy of the grades of existence. And because of this constant ruling presence of the Overmind, the mind in man is a progressive entity unveiling powers lent or delegated to it, sent down into it from the Overmind. The animal, on the contrary, is not a progressive being like man, for the Overmind does not reach it. The animal is not in contact with the Overmind. It is in contact, a somewhat precarious contact, with the Mind. Something of the Mental has made an inroad into him, into his vital texture. It is to be noted that the mind in the animal is of a different kind from the human mind: it is only in the domesticated animals, the animals living in the neighbourhood of man, having contact with him, that something of the human mind percolates Or is imbibed. As I have said, the human mind has developed and is developing fast, specially in recent years, to an extraordinary degree, in the domain of physical science leading to discoveries that appear so subtle and distant, far off as almost to be out of reach of his normal means of experience. Discoveries of other kinds, hints and intimations with regard to other forms and fields of knowledge and experience are explained most logically and adequately by the fact of an interruption or intervention of another type of consciousness into the present constitution of the human mind. We are referring to the influence of the Overmind, gradually becoming more and more explicit, extensive and effective, the immediately directing power, the guide of the new age. And this naturally because of the operative presence, in and through the Overmind, of the Supramental upon earth and in earth."

"SUPERMIND is not a function, an extended function of the mind as someone seems to have presumed. Is Life then a function, an extended function of Matter? Is Mind also in its turn\" a function, an extended function of Life? With equal reason one might conclude that God is an extended function of man and even Heaven an extended function of Earth!

A Sanskrit wit in trying to portray a pig for the benefit of one who has never seen the animal said (in joke or in earnest, one does not know): a pig is an elephant reduced or a mouse enlarged; it would be equally cogent or correct to say that the mind is the Supermind in reduced proportions or that the Supermind is the mind in enlarged proportions. One may \"also remember in this connection Aesop's story of the boasting frog who wanted to inflate or blow himself into the size of a bull and blew himself up and burst into fragments in the attempt. The fate of the mind is likely to be the same if it attempted to magnify itself to the measure of Supermind.

However far the mind may be stretched, it cannot reach the Supermind. It is not a question of degree, but of kind, norm and quality. Even so, Matter, however subtilised, de-mate­rialised remains Matter – pulverized into infinitesimal particles at the farthest limits of the material universe it, does not abandon its material nature, it does not become Life. So again with regard to Life: Life-force, however extended or subtilised, does not acquire the mental power and become Mind. Matter evinces Life-power only when life is injected into it, Life exits somewhere else, exists by itself. In the same way Life betrays mental power when Mind is injected into it, mind is by itself something else. The difference, we may say, using a philosophical jargon, is not merely *epistemological* but *ontological*. These categories are, in fact, not derivative phenomena but self-existing Reals (noumena). Perhaps the word 'Supermind' itself is somewhat responsible for a misconstruction and mis­understanding. Supermind does not mean a \"superior mind\", it means beyond mind, away from mind, unreachable for *mind – aprāpya manasā saha*.

Supermind is not a function: It is a reality, *the* reality itself, the fundamental substance that underlies the world and its formulations of Mind, Life and Matter. It is that secret Energy of Consciousness and Being that lies as the seed and sprouts up and gradually expresses itself in its variant poises of mount­ing potency. These poises are not mere functions: a function is just the expression or operation of an already acquired or established power. It is a deducible conclusion from known and given data, the data and the conclusion are of the same basic nature, that is commensurable entities. Life and Matter are however not commensurable entities nor, Mind and Life. Even so the Supermind and Mind do not belong to the same category of objective reality. If that was so, one could very justifiably and in high seriousness proclaim in Sri Aurobindo's words − those radiant lines, bursting, as it were, with a sup­pressed laughter: 

>A DREAM OF SURREAL SCIENCE

One dreamed and saw a gland write Hamlet, drink
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;At the Mermaid, capture immortality;
A committee of hormones on the Aegean's brink
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Composed the Iliad and the Odyssey.
 
A thyroid, meditating almost nude
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Under the Bo-tree, saw the eternal Light
And, rising from its mighty solitude,
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Spoke of the Wheel and eightfold Path all right.
 
A brain by a disordered stomach driven
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thundered through Europe, conquered, ruled and fell,
From St. Helena went, perhaps, to Heaven.
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thus wagged on the surreal world, until

A scientist played with atoms and blew out
The universe before God had time to shout.[^4]

The distinct and disparate realities have a substratum of unity, even identity, but that is somewhere else, that is precisely what the Supermind is, God's Parac1ete to creation.

"The Age of Reason came and deposed God. It said and proved rationally that God is an irrelevant, unnecessary quantity. Reason is sufficient to hold together mankind and the world, to develop, elevate and illumine them as much as it is necessary. The Great Revolution declared: the *Republic − ResPublica – has* no need of God. Morality, a system of morals is the sole sufficient solid base; it is a known and proven reality, nothing illusory or imaginary, nothing nebulous or sup­positional about it .

Things went on well, at least one thought like that, for sometime, but then it was realised soon enough that something was missing in this rationalistic frame of life, for it was almost lifeless, dry: it does not evoke enthusiasm, does not drive man spontaneously towards heigher hights and deeper depths. Man remains a groundling. God need not be there: but the feeling that is associated with God and the conception of God – which is usually called the religious feeling is a genuine human feeling and with the rejection of God, the feeling does not go, it persists. So a new religion is proposed, a Godless religion, a Natural Religion and it came to be called the Religion of Humanity. God was replaced by Humanity. Humanity is a collective reality: to serve it became the ideal, the *summum bonum*. And to serve is to worship and adore. Thus a new deity was installed. To give yourself wholly, to work for the welfare of humanity, body and mind, to love one and all human beings, particularly those who deserve love and care – the poor, the needy, the lowly – to work so that they may be comforted, is to bring comfort to yourself, to your own soul. It is nothing short of the purest and deepest religious feeling.

Is it so? The Age of Reason made its momentous declaration long ago: it is now almost two hundred years, but actually we find man refuses to forget God. Churches and temples, com­munities and corporations have been cropping up always demanding that God is to be called God, He cannot be called by any other name. He is to be worshipped as God. No lesser gods but the Supreme God Himself. Does not the Bible say: \"I the Lord thy God am a jealous God\" ?[^5]

A Godless morality or a Religion of Humanity, even at its best is a truncated truth. These do not possess the imperious urge of the total man; it is a headless waif wandering about in search of what it wants in this dreary wilderness of Existence.

The ancient Rishis of India knew better. They have never been for compromising for lesser truths. They said: Seek the one inalienable invariable Truth, leave all the rest aside, concentrate on that one thing alone. Even, they added, the rest is Maya, illusion, unreal, false.

They were terribly radical, iconoclasts. Cut away, they said, this world, this humanity, this nature. Go beyond into the transcendent. First enter and establish yourself there. That is the Supreme God, that is the own home of Truth. Cling to that unshakable status, thereafter only you can know of other things, then only you will know what to reject, what to accept, otherwise you will live in a glimmering mid-world of half­truths.

The Transcendental can be reached only in the transcen­dental way, not by pursuing the normal track, continuing the habitual line of gradual growth and development. The mea­sures – the tensor and vector, to use again a jargon, a mathe­matical one – of the mental consciousness do not apply there. There is a cut, a gap, a hiatus between Here and There; one has to take a leap to cross over. Nature herself has adopted that procedure. She has risen from stage to stage through successive leaps, *per salturn*. Man has to do the same but con­sciously. He has to jump over and land on the other side with the head foremost and down, in other words, there is to be a reversal of consciousness; you stand on your head: you do not move clock-wise but perhaps anti-clockwise. You see things with another eye, the third eye – wide extended in heaven, as the Vedic Rishi says ― you look from above down. Things take a different shape and value. The world is constructed in another way.

However, the Transcendent is also here within you. But to reach there too, the procedure is the same ― to jump over and stand on your head. How to do? Something of that acrobatics is taught by what is called in India ―Yoga.

>*This was the day when Satyavan must die*.
 
THE day is come, the fateful day, the last day of the twelve happy months that they have passed together. She knew it, it was foretold, it was foreseen. And she was preparing herself for it all the while, harbouring a pain deep-seated within the heart, revealed to none, not even to her mother, not even to Satyavan. Satyavan was innocent like a child, oblivious of the fate that was coming upon him. The two went out of the hermitage into the forest; for she wished to move about in the company of Satyavan in the midst of the happy greeneries where Satyavan had passed his boyhood, his youth. She was watching Satyavan at every step, she did not want to be caught unawares:

>Love in her bosom hurt with jagged edges
>Of anguish moaned at every step with pain
>Crying, \"Now, now perhaps his voice will cease
>For ever\". . .[^6]

She was on tip-toe as it were, almost breathless, the end must be coming on fast.  

>Her life was now in seconds, not in hours,
>And every moment she economised...[^7]

Satyavan in playfulness was cutting the branch of a tree with a joyous axe and on. his lips:
 
>. . . high snatches of a sage's chant
>That pealed of conquered death and demons slain, [^8]
 
All of a sudden the doom came upon him, he felt a biting pain through his body and an invading suffocation besieged him. He threw away the axe and cried out to Savitri:


&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;\"Savitri, a pang
>Cleaves through my head and breast. . .
>Such agony rends me. . . .
>Awhile let me lay my head upon thy lap. . .\"[^9]

Savitri saw the end coming and she was ready:
 
>All grief and fear were dead within her now
>And a great calm had fallen.[^10]

His life was ebbing away and
 
>He cried out in a clinging last despair,
>\"Savitri, Savitri, 0 Savitri,
>Lean down, my soul, and kiss me while I die\".
              
>His cheek pressed down her golden arm. She sought
>His mouth still with her living mouth, as if
>She could persuade his soul back with her kiss;
>Then grew aware they were no more alone.
>Something had come there conscious, vast and dire.
>Near her she felt a silent shade immense. . . . .[^11]
 
Death is come claiming his prey, Satyavan must go and leave Savitri.

"Death is carrying away Satyavan, the luminous soul of Satyavan. The Great Shadow is leading the way, Satyavan following and Savitri clinging to his steps. Death saw Savitri pursuing, he turned and tried to dissuade her from the pursuit. Savitri refused to turn back. Death warned her, it was already a wrong and anomalous act that she has done to have crossed over to his sphere in her earthly personal being. It is time now to go back. Savitri answered that she would go back only with Satyavan in his earthly body. Death became impatient and answered: \"You ask for the impossible. You want to go back to earth for earthly happiness. You can have that in plenty without Satyavan. Satyavan has passed beyond and there is no return for him.\" But Savitri was firm in her resolution:   
>\"I claim back Satyavan as he was, my happiness is with him alone.\"
>As they proceeded, they mounted higher and higher regions of being. And a change was coming on visibly on Savitri. Death was explaining to her that happiness on earth or in earthly life is not the supremely desirable thing. The supreme desirable thing is to discard the maya of earthly life, that vale of tears and rise into the very source, the origin of creation, the infinite peace and silence. As Death was receding towards that ultimate Nothingness, the Divinity that Savitri was, the mighty Godhead that took a human shape, manifested itself more and more shedding all around her a great effulgence, a mighty power. She had entered into Death's own lair and identified herself with Death's self which is the Divine Himself. In that great burning Light Death was consumed and dissolved.

>The dire universal shadow disappeared
>Vanishing into the Void from which it came.
            
>And Satyavan and Savitri were alone.[^12]
 >They stand face to face with the supreme Divine alone.

There is yet a last choice to make. Death has been annihilated and immortality attained. One can rest there and enjoy immortality eternally beyond the mortal creation. But there is a greater destiny for the human soul. Ignorance is darkness indeed but to enter into Light alone is to enter into a greater darkness. And Savitri has attained the immortality as a human being, as human personality. She is to bring down that im­mortality into the human creature upon earth. She refuses the everlasting day and turns to come down again into the twilight mortality with all her immortal stature so that human beings may be rebuilt in that mould.
So they come down, Satyavan and Savitri, from the Supreme heavens, rushing down as heaven's blessing as it were, through ethereal atmospheres, gradually re-assuming the texture of earthly form till they found their material body again upon this concrete earth.

>A power leaned down, a happiness found its home.
>Over wide earth brooded the infinite bliss.[^13]

"Satyavan lay on the green sward, over him and around green branches spread their peaceful felicity. His head reposed upon the lap of Savitri ― exactly as he lay at the last fateful hour confronting the mighty shadow ― as if there were no gap or hiatus in between, the great intervening experience was just a momentary vision and not the ageless Calvary that it seemed to be in the other sphere. But now 

>The waking gladness of her members felt
>The weight of heaven in his limbs. . . .
>And all her life was conscious of his life. . .
>Human she was once more, earth's Savitri,
>Yet felt in her illimitable change.[^14] 

Satyavan's being was there:
 
>Pure, passionate with the passion of the gods.
>Desire stirred not its wings; for all was made
>An overarching of celestial rays
>Like the absorbed control of sky on plain,
>Heaven's leaning down to embrace from all sides earth,[^15] 
 
Satyavan now turned to Savitri, vague recollections rose in him and he cried out in wonder: 
 
>\"Whence hast thou brought me captive back, love-chained,
>To thee and sunlight's walls, 0 golden beam
>And casket of all sweetness, Savitri,
>Godhead and woman, moonlight of my soul ?\"[^16]

>As he gazed upon her, his wonder grew more and more with a new flame of worship in his eyes and he exclaimed once more:

>\"What high change is in thee, 0 Savitri? Bright
>Ever thou wast, a goddess still and pure,
>Yet dearer to me by thy sweet human parts
>Earth gave thee making thee yet more divine.\"[^17]

The embodied Divine does not discard or even minimise the human; on the contrary greatens and heightens this earthly being. It is a sea-change that is wrought in the content and in a certain modality of the form, but the essential form and content remain ― somewhat like the process of fossilisation ― mortality is squeezed out and all is moulded in immortality; the Divinity is there in all its fullness but there is added to it the exquisiteness that earth brings to the human. 

And so Savitri says:

>\"We have borne identity with the Supreme
>And known his meaning in our mortal lives.
 
>Yet nothing is lost of mortal love's delight.
>Heaven's touch fulfils but cancels not our earth:
 
>Still am I she who came to thee mid the murmur
>Of sunlit leaves upon this forest verge;
>I am the Madran, I am Savitri.\"[^18]

This is human as human can be, the quintessence of hu­manity; for it is human divinely.

          txt: 
"I LEARNED that you want to know something about Sri Aurobindo and the Mother from me. But then there are three lines of approach: you may want to know *about* them, know *of* them or know them. Of course the last is the best. Indeed if you want to know truly something you have to become it. Becoming gives the real knowledge. But becoming Sri Aurobindo and the Mother means what? Becoming a portion of them, a part and parcel of their consciousness ― that is what we are here for. And if you can do that, you know enough. . . .

Once I told you, I think, how to study or approach Sri Aurobindo and the Mother in order to read them or understand their writings.There are two things: studying and reading; I made a distinction between the two. To study Sri Aurobindo is ― I won't say fruitless, that is too strong a word, but it can only be an aid or a supplementary way. Study means: you take the text, you understand mentally each word and phrase; if you don't understand, you take a dictionary and try to catch the external meaning expressed by the words. That may be necessary but it is not the way to approach their works.

Simply to read them in the right way is sufficient. Read, it does not matter what you understand and what you do not, simply read and wait in an expectant silence. In studying you approach them with your external mind, your external intelligence. But what is there in the text is beyond your mind, beyond your intelligence. And to understand mentally means you drive your intellect forward into the thing. It is an effort and takes you only to the outside of the thing. It is an exercise of your brain, developed in that way, but it doesn't take' you very far. Instead of that, suppose you could keep quiet, silence your mind, and only read, without unduly trying to understand, and wait for what is there in the text to enter into you. Instead of your intelligence driving forward, pushing forward and trying to catch the thing, let the thing come into you; for what is there in their writings is not words and phrases, dead material, it is something very living, something conscious, that they have expressed in the words, phrases and the sound and rhythm. And I may tell you that each sentence anywhere, not to speak of *Savitri*, is a living being with whom you have to make acquaintance ― not that you understand or are able to explain, but it is a living being, an entity, a friend, even a Lover whom you have to know. And your attempt in that way will be rewarded. You will enjoy much more. You may ask: \"Just because I open a book and read, how can what are in the lines come to me?\" But I say they are living entities ― if you approach in the right spirit, they come into you. The consciousness, the being in each line comes to you. And you find how beautiful it is. This is an approach of love, not of the intellect to understand and explain. Take for example, the very first verse of *Savitri*:

  >It was the hour before the Gods awake.[^1]

It is a Mantra, a living person, how beautiful it is, you needn't understand much ― and a whole world is there.

Or, take the opening sentence of *The Life Divine ― the* rolling cadence of the vast ocean is there. It brings you a sense of vastness, a sense of Infinity and takes you there. And, as I said, it is a very living entity and personality.

>Here is the whole passage:

  The earliest preoccupation of man in his awakened thoughts and, as it seems, his inevitable and ultimate preoccupation, ― for it survives the longest periods of scepticism and returns after every banishment, ― is also the highest which his thought can envisage: It manifests itself in the divination of Godhead, the impulse towards perfection, the search after pure Truth and unmixed Bliss, the sense of a secret immortality. The ancient dawns of human knowledge have left us their witness to this constant aspiration; today we see a humanity satiated but not satisfied by victorious analysis of the externalities of Nature preparing to return to its primeval longings. The earliest formula of Wisdom promises to be its last, ― God, Light, Freedom, Immortality.[^2]

  There is indeed a personality behind it and you have to make acquaintance with that personality. That is what I meant when I said: become it, by an approach through love, an approach through your soul. Even in studies you shouldn't approach with the mere intellect, mere mental understanding; however fine an understanding or intellect you may have, it won't lead you very far. Only through your soul you can go far. Even intellectual things can be approached through your soul ― because the soul is the very essence of all your faculties and being. The soul is not mere consciousness, mere being, it gathers in all the elements of your personality. The seeds of your mind, your vital, even of the physical personality, the true physical personality, are there in your soul, and you can establish a true relation with things and persons through that part of your being ― your soul. And remember the soul is not very far from you because you are that-rather your mind, your vital, your physical are away from you; they are not your true personality. It is your soul that is nearest to you.

  In this connection you may remember what the Mother has said more than once: what is one here for? What are the children here for? And what is she giving here in the school, in the playground, in all the activities? It is not simple efficiency in the outer activities that is given here, or meant to be given here. For such things one can get outside in a more successful way-external efficiency of your intellect, of your mind, of your vital capacity and your physical strength-the Russian or the German type. Our records don't match theirs, do they? But we don't aspire for those records. For, as the Mother has said: \"I am giving here something which you won't get anywhere else in the world-nowhere except here.\" In your external expression you may cut a very poor figure: low marks-but that is not the sign of the Truth that we acquire here. You acquire it even without your knowing it. When you are in the swimming pool you are soaked all through, aren't you?

  You can't help it; so here also; even without your knowing it you are soaked with the inner consciousness of your soul. It is a very precious thing ― I should say, the only precious thing in the world. And through that, if you study, you learn ― if you approach that way, you will get another taste, another interest in things.

When I was reading with Sri Aurobindo, he didn't lay much stress upon the grammar or the language ― just the most elementary grammar that was necessary. He used to put me in contact with the life, the living personality of the poet ― what he was, what he represented in his consciousness. That was the central theme, because a truly great poet means a status of consciousness; in order to understand his consciousness you must become identified with his being.

Amrita also used to say the same thing, because he was learning the Gita from Sri Aurobindo. He could feel the spirit of Krishna and the spirit of Arjuna throughout ― their relations and the atmosphere they created. It is not the mere lesson, the teaching, that is important ― that is secondary. The person is the primary thing. And the person in the book or outside, you can approach only through your soul, through love. The soul alone can love.

I think I told you that once somebody asked me: \"You speak of the soul but where is it?\"

I said: \"It is very near you; still you don't believe. If you see into yourself quietly, you will find that there are very many good things in you, not only bad things ― bits perhaps, shades or shadows perhaps, but you know this is a good thought in you, this is a noble impulse, a sweet feeling. Each one has all these things, you have only to recognise them. All this is the expression of the soul in you. The beautiful, the luminous, the noble things that appear to you, in your consciousness, from time to time, all come from your soul.\" Even the greatest villain has such moments. You remember Lady Macbeth ― known as the cruellest woman; well, she said about Duncan, \"I would have killed him myself but he looked like my father\"[^3] ― well, that is the feeling even she had. So let us not despair, even the weakest among us should not despair. First of all, each one has a soul, and secondly, we have the luminously strong sup port of the Mother. It is the nature of the Divine that even if you don't think of Him He thinks of you. It is true, very true; because you are part of the Divine. Only you have to concentrate consciously on that part, that portion; then gradually it will increase.

 *Question: What is the distinction you make between \"to know about Sri Aurobindo and the Mother,\" and \"to know of them\"?*
 
ANSWER: \"About\" means what a man does, what his profession is, his occupation ― *kimāsita vrajeta kim?* ― and \"of\"means his personality, his character, nature.

"IT seems my predecessors were telling you stories ― stories of their own lives; their experiences, so I thought I should follow in their footsteps. But I am not going to tell you about my own experiences, I am going to tell a story, rather a history, that happened in the life of another person. It will be interesting and also instructive. So I will begin the story, I am the narrator:

I was a traveller, going about from place to place, seeing all things of interest ― especially those of pilgrimage ― and I happened to be in Madras. I was waiting there to take a bus to the railway-station which was a few miles off. I saw that there were also many other travellers waiting to board a bus.A busman was inviting people, so I approached his bus. Suddenly a lady came out of the crowd and said, \"Please don't go there!\" She was an elderly Tamil lady. I was surprised and asked, \"Why, why?\" She said, \"Well, wait; you'll see,\" and I stopped. Then there were three buses that started ― I was in one, the lady was in another and the third was the one I had wanted to board.

The lady's bus came last and the other two were running very fast ― competing as to which should go first. Well, what happened is quite natural; the bus in which I was to go dashed against a wayside tree and was damaged, and the passengers were mostly killed or seriously injured. We reached our destination and naturally I was very eager to see the lady who had stopped me from boarding the bus. I asked her, \"How did you know it? How did you guess?\" \"I'll tell you later on.\" So we started again, and went to a holy place on a hillside. It was a sort of jungle and woodland, full of bushes. The lady and I were walking quietly together. Then I stepped aside. I wanted to see what was to my left. Suddenly the lady said, \"Please, please don't go to that side!\" Naturally I was surprised and asked her the reason. Then I saw that behind the bushes was a 200 ft. deep precipice. If 1 had taken one step more I would have gone down! Then I pleaded with the lady: \"Please tell me what it is; how did you see it?\" She said, \"All right, I'll tell you the story, let us sit down.\" Then she narrated the story. She said, \"When I was young I lived with my grand father, and we loved each other exceedingly, we were very much attached to each other. He used to tell me stories and pleased me in all ways, so I was with him almost all the time. Then one day he fell rather seriously ill. Doctors were called and they couldn't do anything. Then my grandfather called me and said, 'My child, go and pray to Shiva'-Shiva was the household deity. So I went and knelt down before the image of Shiva and prayed, '0 Shiva, my grandfather is ill, please cure him.' One or two days I did that. But he continued to be ill, he became rather worse! Then one day the doctors gave up all hope. I was weeping standing a little away from him. Suddenly I saw a girl by the side of my grandfather, and I was astonished, she looked exactly like myself. Then I asked someone near me if he could see anyone by my grandfather ― 'No, I don't see anybody'. Then I went to the bedside, and the image and I stood together. Gradually my grandfather was cured. From that time on, wherever there is any danger, any difficulty, this image of myself comes, and helps me. So when you wanted to go in that bus I saw the same figure coming to me and telling me, 'Beware'. I don't know who she is.\"

So this is the story. I have brought these books because some of the poets have had such an experience.

Alfred de Musset says that from his childhood he had a comrade who was always with him ― he was like a brother to him; he accompanied him in life's joys and sorrows, in dangers and happiness-he was always with him. I shall read out some stanzas: 

>*Nuit de Dlcembre*[^4]

>*Du temps que j'étais éIcolier,
>Je restais un soir à veiller*

>*Dans notre salle solitaire.
>Devant ma table vine s' assenir
>Un pauvre enfant vêtu de noir,
>Qui me ressemblait comme un frère.* 
 
>*Son visage était triste et beau:
>A la lueur de mon flambeau,
>Dans mon livre ouvert il vine lire.
>II pencha son front sur ma main,
>Et resta jusqu' au lendemain,
>Pensif, avec un doux sourire.* 
 
>*Comme j' allais avoir quinze ans,
>Je marchais un jour, à pas lents,
>Dans un bois, sur une bruyère.
>Au pied d'un arbre vine s'asseoir
>Un jeune homme vetu de noir,
>Qui me ressemblait comme un frère.* 
 
>*Je lui demandai mon chemin;
>II tenait un luth d' une main,
>De I' autre un bouquet d' églantine.
>II me fit un salut d' ami,
>Et, se détournant à demi,
>Me montra du doigt la colline.*
 
>*Je m' en suis si bien souvenu,
>Que je I' ai toujours reconnu
>A tous les instants de ma vie.
>C' est une étrange vision,
>Et cependant, ange ou demon,
>J' ai vu partout cette ombre amie.* 
 
>*Partout où, Ie long des chemins,
>J' ai posé mon front dans mes mains
>Et sangloé comme une femme;
>Partout où, j' ai, comme un mouton
>Qui laisse sa laine au buisson,
>Senti se dénuer mon âme;*

>*Partout où, j' ai voulu dormir,
>Partout où, j' ai voulu mourir,
>Partout où, j' ai touché la terre,
>Sur ma route est venu s' asseoir  
>Un malheureux vêtu de noir,
>Qui me ressemblait comme un frère.*
 
>*\"Qui donc es-tu, spectre de ma jeunesse,
Pélerin que rien n' a lassé?
>Dis-moi pourquoi je te trouve sans cesse
>Assis dans I' ombre où, j' ai passé.
>Qui donc es-tu, visiteur solitaire,
>Hôte assidu de mes douleurs?\"*

Now this form, that the poet saw, replies:
 
>*\"―Ami, noire Père est Ie lien.
Je ne suis ni I' ange gardien,
Ni Ie mauvais destin des hommes . . .*
 
*Lee ciel m' a confié ton cmur.
Quand tu seras dans la douleur,
Viens à moi sans inquiétude.
Je te suivrai sur Ie chemin;
Mais je ne puis toucher ta main,
Ami, je ne suis que la Solitude.\"*

>Here is the English translation

>A  DECEMBER  NIGHT
 
>In the days when I was a schoolboy
>One evening I kept awake
>In my lonely room.
>In front of my table there came and sat
>A poor child robed in black
>Who looked like me even as a brother.
 
>His face was sad and beautiful:
>In the light of my lamp

>He came to read in my open book.
>He bent his head upon my hand
>And waited till the morn
>Musing with a sweet smile.
 
>When I was about to be fifteen years old
>I was walking one day leisurely
>In a woodland upon the heath,
>At the foot of a tree there came and sat
>A young man robed in black
>Who looked like me even as a brother.
 
>I asked him my way;
>He held a lute in one hand,
>And in the other a bouquet of eglantine.
>He gave a friendly salute to me
>And, half turning,
>With his finger pointed to the hillock.
 
>I remember him so well,
>I have recognised him always
>At every moment of my life.
>It was a strange vision,
>And yet, angel or demon,
>I saw everywhere this friendly shadow.
 
>Wherever all along my way
>I held my forehead in my hands
>And sobbed like a woman;
>Wherever, like a lamb
>That leaves his wool in the bush,
>I felt my soul being shed;
 
>Wherever I sought to sleep,
>Wherever I sought to die,
>Wherever I touched the earth
>On my road came and sat
>A miserable one robed in black,
>Who looked like my own brother.

\"Who art thou, phantom of my youth,
Pale pilgrim whom nothing fatigues?
Tell me, why do I find thee constantly,
Seated in the shadow I have passed through?
Who art thou, lonely visitor,
Tireless guest of my pain?\"
 
\"Friend, our father is also thine,
 I am neither the guardian angel
Nor the evil destiny of men. . . .
 
Heaven has entrusted thy heart to me.
When thou art in pain
Come to me carefree,
I shall follow thee on thy way;
But I cannot touch thy hand,
Friend, I am Solitude.\"

The poet thinks that it is the personification of solitude, but it is something more than that. As I said, it is your other self, your subtle self. The body, the personality that you see externally is only a reflection of the inner being that you are. I don't mean your spiritual personality, but your subtle material self ― which is physically your true personality. And that is inspired by something greater which you all know ― your true individuality ― your psychic being. But that being can only be perceived, seen and experienced and heard in solitude, in loneliness ― what you call calmness and quietness and detachment. This vision here, this being of Alfred de Musset says: \"I can approach you but I cannot touch you; there is a separation between the two. We can touch only when there are some conditions fulfilled in the physical body.\"

Another French poet speaks of a similar experience. He speaks of it in a jocular way, in a funny way. He says that this inner self sees things in a quite different way than the external being does. Sometimes it does quite the opposite. While the physical eye says 'It is this', the other says 'No, it is that'. Different values and perceptions ― what we see externally is only Maya. There is only a rope, but you see a snake there ― that is Maya.

>He is a modern French poet, Supervielle. The poem is amusing:

>ALTER EGO[^5]

>In my outward experience I see a mouse running away.
>\"Une souris s' échappe\"
>(A mouse runs out)

>But the other person says:
>\"ce n' en était pas une\"
>(It was not there)

>The outward person says:
>\"Une femme s' éveille\"
>(A woman wakes)

>The other says:
>\"Comment le savez-vous?\"
>(How do you know?

>And then my outward sense says:
>\"Et La porte qui grince\"
>(And the squeaking door)
>\"On l' huila ce matin\"     
>(It was oiled this morning)

>But if it was oiled this morning, how can it make noise?
>\"Près du mur de cloture\"
>(Near the cloister wall)
>\"Le mur n'existe plus\"
>(There is now no wall)
 
>\"Ah! je ne puis rim dire\"
>(Oh! I can't say a thing)

>Because you always say the contrary.
>The inner being says:

>Eh bien, vous vous taisez!
>(Well, now you'll be quiet!)

>The outward person says: I can't walk

>\"Je ne puis pas bouger\",
>(I cannot move)
>\"Vous marchez sur La route\"
(You're walking along the road)

>The outer questioning mind says:

>\"Où allons-nous aussi?\"
>(Does all this get us anywhere?)
>\"C'est moi qui le demande\"
>(I am asking you)

>I think:
>\"Je suis seul sur La Terre\"
>(I am alone on Earth)

>The other r person says:

>\"Je suis La pres de vous\"
>(I am here beside you)

>The outer person says

>\"Peut-on être si seul?\"
>(Can one be so alone?)
>\"Je Ie suis plus que vous\"
>(I am more alone than you)
>\"Je vois votre visage\”
>(I can see your face)
>\"Nul ne m'a jamais VU\"
>(No one has ever seen mine).

>‘I see you but nobody has seen me’ ― that is the inner personality.

These outer personalities ― there is not one, there are many ― you consider this body of yours as your only form, but you have many. Each level has its own individual form and a recognisable one. Each one has special eyes, nose, ears, so this inner personality also has recognisable features. If you know, you can even name them ― it is this person, that person. The subtle physical is more concrete. Only the physical form, the material form does not change much. It changes, yes, according to your age, slowly but for sometime you are the same. These inner forms are changeful; they are not restricted to one rigid figure. Still they are recognisable. There is a plasticity which is very natural; according to the situation, according to your mood, according to your feeling, they change. But the most important, the most original form is your psychic being ― your true being ― that which we must strive to realise and attain. As the Mother says: It is the Divine personality in each one of us. Your outer personality is sometimes only a caricature, but still it tries to reflect, though with difficulty, something of the needs and urges of this inmost reality of yours. Someone has asked me: \"How to find, how to know this inner being, the true being in me?\" For, as the poet here says, he can't touch you and you can't touch him, but what you want is to touch that person. The fact is that it is not so altogether out of contact, not altogether ― unless a man is a total villain, which is very rare. You can't obliterate that true existence of you, it is there. It expresses itself in all the movements that are good and noble and selfless. Whenever you see something beautiful or do something nice, be sure that it is your psychic being that sees or does it. The psychic being in you is the Mother ― for it is an emanation of Herself that She has put in you, in order to protect you. When you see the sunset and feel happy, it is the psychic being in you that sees it. It is a small beginning but it is a beginning. Let your psychic being guide your acts. The only thing necessary is to be sincere. You have to be sincere. First day you will find it very difficult, second day you will find it easier, third day it will become still easier and then on the fourth day it will become your nature. It is not easy, but if you try you will be able to do it.

"KING JANAKA was a great king and a great sage. He wielded an empire without and equally an empire within: he had realised the Truth, known Brahman. He was *svarāt* and *samrāt.* A friend and intimate of his was Rishi Yajnavalkya, who also was a sage ― in fact, considered to be the greatest sage of the time, a supreme knower of Brahman.

Once upon a time King Janaka invited sages from everywhere, whoever wanted to come to the assembly. The king from time to time used to call such assemblies for spiritual discussion and interchange of experiences. This time he summoned the assembly for a special reason. He had collected a herd of one thousand cows and nuggets of gold were tied to the horns of each. When all had gathered and taken their places he announced that whoever considered himself the best knower of Brahman (Brahmishtha) might come forward and take away the cows. None stirred. No one had the temerity to declare that he was the best *knower* and the most eligible for the prize. The king repeated his announcement. Then all of a sudden people saw Yajnavalkya advancing and telling his disciples to take hold of the herd and drive it home. A hue and cry arose: How is it? How dare he? One came forward and asked Yajnavalkya: How is it, Yajnavalkya? Do you consider yourself the most wise in the matter of Brahman? First prove your claim and then touch the cows.Yajnavalkya in great humility bowed down and said to the asembly: I bow down to the great sages. I have come here solely with the intention of getting the cows. As for the knowledge of Brahman, I leave it to the knowers of Brahman. All the others in one voice said: That will not do, Yajnavalkya. You cannot get away so easily. Come, sit down and prove your worth. Yajnavalkya had no way of escape. So one by one the sages came up and put questions and enigmas to Yagnavalkya. All he answered quietly and perfectly to their full satisfaction. Towards the end a woman stood up, Gargi, a fair and famous name too. She said: Yajnavalkya, I shall put two questions to you like two arrows directed at you, even as a king shoots his arrows at his enemies; if you can meet and parry them, yours the victory. ― Yajnavalkaya: \"Let me hear then\". ― Gargi: \"Yajnavalkya, you once said that the earth is the warp and woof woven upon water; upon what is woven the water?\" ― Yajnavalkya: \"Air\". ― \"Upon what then is air woven?\" ― \"Sky\". ― \"Upon what is woven the sky?\" ― \"The world of Gandharvas.\" ― \"Upon what the Gandharvas?\"\"Upon the Sun.\" She continued her questioning. And thus she was led successively through higher and higher worlds ― from the Sun to the Moon, then to the Stars, then to the Gods and the King of Gods, then to the Creator of the Gods and the peoples[^6] and finally to the Brahmaloka (the world of the One Supreme Transcendent Reality).

  Gargi still continued and asked again: \"Upon what is Brahman woven?\" To this Yajnavalkya cried halt and warned her: \"Now, Gargi, your questioning goes too far, beyond the limits. If you question farther, your head will fall off. You are questioning about a thing that does not bear questioning ― *mā ati prāksih― anati praśnyā devatā ― the* Gods abide not our question.\" So Gargi had to desist and Yajnavalkya was accepted as the best of the sages (Brahmishtha) and he could drive his cattle away home.

The ultimate reality does not lie within the ken of the questioning mind, the Upanishad emphatically declares. We all know the famous mantra: *naisā tarkena matirāpaneyā ― this* consciousness cannot be reached by reasoning nor by intelligence nor by much learning. Indeed the Self, the Divine discloses his body to him alone whom he chooses as his own."

"It is to be noted that even when at the top of the consciousness, full of the Supreme Brahman, one with it, Yajnavalkya does not lose hold of the earthly foothold ― he does not forget his cows, and thereby hangs another amusing tale of his.

Once King Janaka, as it was customary, was holding his court and there was a large assembly of people ― courtiers, ministers, officials, petitioners and a crowd of curious visitors. All of a sudden stepped in Yajnavalkya. The king saw him, and after welcoming him asked with an ironical smile what he was there for. Did he come for cows (referring to the previous episode) or for the knowledge of Brahman? Yajnavalkya too answered with a beatific smile: 0 King, I come for both *ubhayameva samrāt*.

In other words, even after passing through all the inferior worlds, the intermediary formulations of the Supreme, even after passing beyond, Yagnavalkya does not reject these stations as delusions but accepts them, subsumes them, within one integral consciousness ― something in the manner imaged in those famous lines of Wordsorth:
 
>Type of the wise who soar but never roam,
>True to the kindred points of heaven and home. [^7]"

"Yajnavalkya one day, as it was almost habitual with him, walked up straight to the royal court, into the very presence of King Janaka and quietly took his seat ― a seat always reserved for him.He came with the idea of not opening the conversation. He kept quiet. The King however immediately started and said: Yajnavalkya, I have a question to put to you. Please answer.

>YAJNAVALKYA: I am ready, 0 King! Let me hear.
>KING: What is the light that man has?
>Y: The sun is man's light.
>K: And when the sun has set?
>Y: The moon is his light.
>K: When the sun has set, when the moon has set, what light has man?
>Y: The fire is his light.
>K: When the sun has set, when the moon has set, when the fire has gone out, what then is man's light?
>Y: The self is his light.
>K: And what is this self?
>Y: The self is the conscious Being, master of life-energies, dwelling within the heart.

Yajnavalkya's answer has been put succinctly and most beautifully in another Upanishad, the most beautiful verse in the whole Upanishadic literature. Here it is:

>There the sun shines not, nor the moon, nor the stars; nor do these ligtnings shine there. And how can this fire be there? That shines and in its wake all others shine. By the light of That all this becomes luminous.[^8]

All other lights, lights of the heaven, lights upon earth are evanescent. They pass away, the only light that endures and never fails is the light of the soul.

[^6]: It is difficult to locate or identify the Upanishadic worlds or explain their gradations; evidently they are symbolical. But for us it is sufficient if we know that they are mounting steps, higher and higher tiers of being and consciousness leading to the supreme Being and Consciousness, the Brahman.

[^7]:*Poems of Imaginations*, \"To a Skylark\".

[^8]:This is a literal translation. Sri Aurobindo gives a beautifully poetic translation, rather a transcreation of the *mantra.* Here it is:
\"There the sun cannot shine and the moon has no lustre; all the stars are blind; there our lightnings flash not, neither any earthly fire. For all that is bright is but the shadow of His brightness and by His shining all this shines.\" ―  Sri Aurobindo: *The Upanishads,* Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library, Vol. 12, p. 261. "

"LAST time I told you the story of the great Rishi Yajnavalkya. But that was about the later Yajnavalkya when he had become a full-fledged rishi, a guru with an Ashram and disciples. Today I will tell you something of the earlier Yajnavalkya, the beginning of his rishihood, the start of his spiritual life. You know the structure of the old Indian society, it consisted of four castes, varnas, and four stages, āśramas. I shall speak of the āśramas now. Each individual person had to follow a definite course of life through developing stages. First of all, naturally, when you are a baby, in your early childhood, you belong to the family and remain with your parents. As soon as you grow up and the time for your education arrives, you are initiated into a stage called brahmacarya; you may generally call it as the stage of self-discipline, you go to a guru and pursue your studies through a disciplined life, something like the life of the children who are here like you. In those days a student's life did not mean merely studies, that is to say, reading and writing, book knowledge, but as here a very active life. The physical education in the old time āśramas in certain ways was even more complete than what is given here, for it included the art of warfare also, combatives like serious archery and many other items of physical training. When you have terminated this discipline or brahmacarya, when you have become an accomplished young man you are allowed to return to the world, and take to the worldly life, enrich yourself with all experiences of that life, that is to say, you marry and become a family man. It is the second stage called gārhashtya. Next when you have fully enjoyed or fulfilled the duty of the worldly life, you pass on to the next stage that is called the vānaprastha . That is the hermit life, the beginning of the true spiritual life. Finally at the end of the vānaprastha, you pass still beyond and adopt the life of the sannyasi, abandoning everything, concentrating wholly on the Supreme Truth and merging into it.

Now our Yajnavalkya in the normal course of things has passed through the stage of brahmacarya, he has also pursued the stage of domestic life and is now at the end of it. He thinks the time has now come to him to take to spiritual life and enter into vānaprastha. He had married and had two wives. So one day he called the first wife, Katyayani, and said to her: \"Katyayani, I am now leaving this life and entering the spiritual life. You have given me comfort and happiness. I am thankful to you for that. Whatever I have, my possessions, movable and immovable, I have divided into two. This is your portion.\" Katyayani accepted the decision without a murmur. She answered: \"Since you are my lord and husband, as you ask me so I shall do.\" Then Yajnavalkya went to his second wife, Maitreyee; to Maitreyee too he said the same thing as he had said to Katyayani: \"Maitreyee, I am leaving this life, I am taking to the spiritual life. I have given to Katyayani her share of my possessions. This is your share.\" But Maitreyee answered: \"Wherever you go, I will follow you, I will also give up the world and its life.\" Yajnavalkya said: \"No Maitreyee, it is a very hard, very difficult life, particularly for a woman. Follow the life to which you have been accustomed. Enjoy freely the possessions I leave you.\" Then Maitreyee uttered those famous words which you must have heard and which have been ringing through the centuries down to us also, even today: \"All these possessions, will they give me immortality?\" Yajnavalkya answered: \"No, Maitreyee, that they will not give you, it is quite another matter.\" Maitreyee answered ― uttering a mantra as it were ― \"What am I to do with that which does not give me immortality?\" So Yajnavalkya had to accept her and allow her to accompany him. Now Yajnavalkya gives his first lesson of spiritual life to Maitreyee: \"Maitreyee, you love me, so you are coming with me. But do you know the real truth of the matter? The real truth is that you do not love me, but you love the soul that is in you, which is also in me: you love your own self in me. Therefore you love me. And I love you, I love you not for your sake but for the sake of the self in you which is the self in me. All love is like that. A husband loves his wife, the wife loves her husband, the brother loves his brother or sister, a sister loves her sister or brother, it is not for the sake of the person or the relation but for the sake of the self-one's own self which is in everybody. That is the first lesson which you have to learn. Forget the outer person, your own person or another's person, find the self that is in you and everybody else. That is the basis of the spiritual life.\"

I told you there were four stages of life for an individual in the ancient Indian society. You complete one stage and then proceed to the next, and then to the next and so on. But they also say that you need not go through the stages gradually, step by step in this way; you can skip one or two stages in your stride if you have the capacity to do so; if you want the spiritual life when you are young, even when you have not gone through the worldly life, even then you can jump over, take a leap into the life of the sannyāsin. It is said the day you feel detached from your worldly home, then forthwith you may take to the life of the ascetic. It depends upon the urge in you, the insistence of the truth in you. A large freedom was given to all who really wanted a spiritual life.

  I have said that Yajnavalkya had two wives. You did not ask me why: for to us moderns such a thing is not only immoral but inconvenient; it is however another story, a long story. In those days, those far-off early days of mankind, thousands and thousands, millions perhaps, of years ago, it was the law, die social custom and it became a duty, to have more than one wife and the relation too between man and woman was much freer and more loose. That was because, as you know, man started his earthly life at a certain stage of creation; before that stage there was no man, there were only animals. The earth was filled with animals, only animals, wild animals, ferocious animals, insects, worms, all kinds of ugly and dangerous creatures. Man came long, long after; he is almost a recent appearance. It was a mysterious, indeed a miraculous happening, how all of a sudden, out of or in the midst of animals there appeared a new creature, quite a different type of animal. Still in whatever way it happened, they were not many in number. The first creation of man must have been a very limited operation, limited in space, limited in number. Perhaps they sprouted up like mushrooms here and there, a hundred here, another hundred there, or perhaps a few thousands ― few and far between. So man led a dangerous and precarious life. All around him these animals, some too big, some too small to be tackled withstood against him, and Nature also was as wild and as much against him. So for self-preservation and survival they needed to be numerous, to increase in number as much as possible. It is exactly what is needed in war; the larger the number of troops, the greater the chance of winning the war. So the impulse in man, in the social aggregate was to have more men, increase the number, to strengthen the extent and volume of the force to be able to fight successfully against the enemy. So a necessity became a religious duty to multiply, to procreate and redouble the race. In later days, even when the necessity was not so imperative, even then the habit and custom continued. To beget children was a praiseworthy thing, the more the number the greater the merit. Women who had numerous children were considered favourities of the gods. King Dasharatha had, it appears, a thousand wives, King Dhritarashtra had more than a hundred, Vashishtha had a hundred sons and King Sagar a thousand. Draupadi had five husbands and she was considered the ideal chaste woman.

In the modern age we have gone to the other extreme, we have tided over the danger of under-population. At the present day it is over-population that threatens the existence of mankind. Now we are anxious, we are racking our brains, trying to find out all kinds of means and ways to restrict and control any increase in population.

I said, in the early days the need to marry in any way ― a very free choice was given in the matter of the way of marriage ― and to procreate was a social duty: but note it is not for individual pleasure. Today we have discarded all notion of that kind of action as superstition, a form of tyranny. We are for freedom of the individual. Whatever we do we must do for our personal gain, our personal pleasure. But in those days that was not the ideal nor the custom. Even when you marry, you marry not for the sake of personal enjoyment but for the sake of the society, to give birth to healthy and useful children, to increase the number of able-bodied members of your society. Service for society, not personal pleasure was the aim. Yajnavalkya lifted that ideal on to a still higher level ― you exist not for your own sake of course-own means the personal ego individual ― but for the sake of your soul, the greater self.

In this connection I am reminded of what Sri Aurobindo said when he was taking leave of his students at Calcutta in his farewell address before starting his public political activity: he said,\"When I come back I wish to see some of you becoming rich, rich not for yourselves but that you may enrich the Mother with your riches. I wish to see some of you becoming great, great not for your own sakes, not that you may satisfy your own vanity, but great for her, to make India great. . .\"[^9]: that is the ideal ideal, not individual satisfaction, exclusively personal accomplishment or achievement; one must work in view of the welfare of all, a global well-being. The goal is not one's own little self, but the Great Self in all. This is of course, in the secular way in the secular field. But here also the appeal, it must be observed, is not to the social life as a mere machine of which individuals are dead helpless parts and units meant to serve as obedient instruments in the production of useful goods. The appeal on the contrary is to the soul, the free inner individual, choosing its destiny but with a view to collaborating and uniting with others in the realisation of a global truth.

In the spiritual sphere also Sri Aurobindo gives us the same ideal and outlook. In the early days spiritual realisation was sought for personal salvation, a complete renunciation of the world, absolute freedom from this transient unhappy world  ― anityam asukham lokam imam. The individual person leaves his individual existence upon earth and retires and merges into the Infinite Brahman. But here in Sri Aurobindo's Revelation we are taught that the individual realisation and spiritual attainment is not to dissolve oneself into the nameless formless Beyond but to maintain it, preserve it in a pure divine form, for the sake of the sorrowful ignorant world. The knowledge, the power, the delight that the individual gains-not as something merely individual but as the result of one's identity with the universal ― are at the service of earth and humanity so that these may be transformed and share in the same realisation. One becomes spiritually free and complete and enters into all so that all may be transformed into a new divine reality.

          txt: 
"TODAY I shall speak to you of the golden rule. When we were children we were taught, specially at school, at home too, certain golden rules. If you observe these rules you become good, good boys and good girls, you are loved and appreciated by all. These rules are simple and very commonplace; you know them all and must have tried them. For example such things as \"speak the truth, do not tell a lie, obey your parents, respect your teachers, do not hurt anybody\" etc., etc. That was the basis on which one was to build one's character, mould one's nature, prepare for a pure stainless noble life.

They are good, these rules, so far as they go: but to say the truth, they do not go very far. They do not touch you intimately. They enter, as it is said, your head through one ear and pass out through the other. They do not quicken your heart and involve your soul. You follow if you are very earnest one rule or another for a few days and then you forget.

  The other day I spoke to you of Yajnavalkya; he gave a better rule that was nearer to the golden rule. What he said in effect was that instead of following these outward rules or formulas you must leave them aside, go within yourself and find your self. Yajnavalkya said: you love your neighbour, not because he is your neighbour or brother, but because you find yourself in him. Find the Self, that is the golden rule. Find the Self that is in you, you will find that very Self in your neighbour, in all.

Here however you must take care not to confuse yourself with your Self. When it is said that you find your Self it is not your personal self that you find in another as if you grasp it as your own, exclusively your own possession. This Self is not the ego, it is beyond ego, it is not the kind of self-hood that Shakespeare depicts in King Richard where the King, deprived of everything, left all alone in the whole world, exclaims: \"Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I\"[^10], for it is not a separative I-ness; the other I's are dissolved as well as the one I that I am, and all become one person or self. It is all one self, one soul although they may appear different, as different I's.

Here I will tell you a story narrated to our children. There used to be every evening a meeting where seekers and enquirers after the spiritual life assembled and conversed or meditated on the subject. There used also to come to that meeting a remark able woman who had true realisations and was ready to help others on the path. Once the talk turned on souls and their re-birth and she was telling how after the death of the body souls pass out into another world, and when the time comes each one returns to the earth and takes a human body. Now there was one in the audience who felt a little puzzled about this matter of birth and wanted clarification. She put a question: (it was a she): \"You say that souls come down and take birth, that is to say, assume a human body. But people are increasing in number upon earth, every year the human population becoming larger and larger. Now the question is: the additional number of people born every year, where were they before? Were they there all along since the creation, waiting? Do they appear gradually as time passes and bide their hour?\" We in the modern age may suggest an analogy. Is it like the stars or galaxies that are gradually coming into our ken, phenomenally distant stars whose lights are taking time to reach the present day earth? The questioner asked: \"Is there a fixed number of souls, can they be counted?\" The speaker answered, \"Yes, they are limited and they can be counted.\" With great curiosity and eagerness the questioner asked: \"How many? how many?\" Quietly the one who was speaking extended her hand and put out one single index finger, and said: \"Only one.\"

So, that is the truth. All these many bodies, many persons you see, it is only appearance, there is only one Soul and every one is that. If you realise this truth, you can love everyone equally, not merely love but be one with all, because you are all and all are you. That universal Self, your own true Self you have to find, you have to know, you have to become. That is the golden rule as the ideal.

How to attain, how to realise it? The Mother in this matter has given us a golden rule, a truly golden rule and very simple. Generally we are confused as to our duty – what to do, what not to do, how to do, how not to do. The Mother says to her children: \"Do not do what you will hesitate to do or be ashamed of doing in my presence. Do not say anything which you will hesitate to say or be ashamed of saying in my presence. Do not think even what you will find awkward to think in my presence\" Well, try this way and you will find what a golden rule and a simple rule it is. Sri Aurobindo confirmed and said the same thing. He says, – you all know the well-known phrase – \"Always behave as if the Mother was looking at you; because she is, indeed, always present.\" You need not imagine that she is there; for she is actually always there whether you imagine or not; you do not know, for you are blind but she is always there, seeing you, observing you, guiding you, protecting you. She not only sees what you do, but even what you feel inside you, even your. most secret thoughts. A child asked the Mother in his simplicity: \"How do you know, Mother, what we do, what we think, what we feel, how do you know it?\" The Mother smiled and answered, \"My child, because you are within me, within my embrace always. Therefore I know. I know what is happening in me, isn't it? That is why I see what is happening in you. You are not outside me, you are part of myself, I am you.\"

  Now if you follow this simple rule sincerely and persistently you will see the change miraculously happening in you, you will become the golden child of the golden Mother. You will find your thoughts, your words, your feelings, your impulses putting on a new colour, even your body will take a new glow of health and beauty. Normally our brain is made of mud, our thoughts are unclean – we have wrong thoughts, dark thoughts, our tongue also is made of mud or clay, we speak wrong things, impure things, our heart too is made of the same substance, giving out wrong feelings and unclean feelings; lower down in our nature in the vital region our impulses are also wrong and muddy and unclean, finally, the body is mud itself, it is made of diseases and weaknesses and incapacities. We are, as it were, a container containing this ugly and unclean mixture. What we have to do is to pour into it the golden liquid, molten gold that will wash away all that impurity and filth, clean the vessel and fill it with its own radiant substance, the molten gold which is the Mother's presence.

This process has been beautifully described by Sri Aurobindo in one of his poems. I conclude by reading out those magnificent lines:

>THE GOLDEN LIGHT [^11]

>Thy golden Light came down into my brain
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the grey  rooms of mind sun-touched became
>A bright reply to Wisdom's occult plane,
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A calm illumination and a flame.
 
>Thy golden Light came down into my throat,
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And all my speech is now a tune divine,
>A paean-song of thee my single note;
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;My words are drunk with the Immortal's wine.
 
>Thy golden Light came down into my heart
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Smiting my life with Thy eternity;
>Now has it grown a temple where Thou art
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And all its passions point towards only Thee.
 
>Thy golden Light came down into my feet:
>My earth is now thy playfield and thy seat.

          t: "Liberty, Self-Control and Friendship",
          txt: 
"WE are a larger assembly here today – we have increased in number.... Now, we all want to be good boys and good girls, is it not? Nobody wants to be a bad boy or a bad girl; but the problem is how to be a good boyar girl and how not to be a bad boy or girl. In what does goodness consist? You all know the fine gesture that Mother taught us once. Gesture means a physical movement – here a physical movement to control yourself; control, self-control is a very important, a very necessary item of our life. So the Mother once said; supposing you are very angry and you are inclined to give a blow to your comrade, then, the Mother's advice is, instead of stretching your hand towards your friend to give him a blow, put it in your pocket; that is a fine gesture and it brings you a fine result: you feel a kind of release, a joy and peace, something new arid fresh comes into you. Your anger is gone, you are almost a new person. That is the lesson Mother taught us in the matter of controlling ourselves. Usually we are moved by our impulses and passions particularly towards wrong things, then what you need is to check yourself, to control yourself. You must note that this control you are taught is self-control, that is to say, it is a thing not forced upon you, you are not compelled to do it. You do it because of your own will, because you like to do it, because it is a fine gesture that attracts you. Usually the control is imposed upon you, out of fear of punishment, because of inconvenient or unpleasant results that might follow your loss of control. So instead of an outsider ruling you, you rule yourself voluntarily. The Mother adds also, illustrating the point: to train, that is to say, to control a wild horse what you do is to put a bridle in its mouth and hold it and check it. That is good for an animal who does not know what he is; for a man, he can do better; he can put the bridle himself in his own mouth, that is what controlling oneself is. It means as a human being you have been given freedom; it is given so that you may choose yourself what is to be done and what is not to be done. Instead of being forced to do the right thing you are given the alternatives either to do the right or do the wrong, to choose between the two and choose the right thing of your free will. Here in the Ashram, the Mother has said very many times, you have been given almost infinite freedom. There are of course certain rules and regulations; naturally when you live in society and have common work to do, there must be some rules and regulations. But the beauty here is that even if you break a rule, even a very important rule, you are not punished. In other words, the choice is left to you, you have broken the rule, you yourself find that you have broken the rule and then you try and rectify yourself, do the right thing. That is the true function of freedom – it is not freedom to do anything you like but to discipline yourself, to follow the right of one's own free will. A discipline here is not inflicted upon you, you are not ordered to do one thing and not to do another under pain of punishment, but you find the truth by yourself and for yourself and you do it yourself, and you have the joy, the pleasure of doing the right thing and the happiness of growing, maturing in your consciousness. You have infinite freedom here so that you may grow in your consciousness infinitely.

I was speaking of self-control, self-discipline in your inner being, that is to say, with regard to your desires and impulses and feelings. It is however the same discipline as you follow with regard to your body in the playground. Physical education means nothing else than controlling and disciplining the body. You control and discipline the body through physical exercises and these mean controlled and guided movements. You have to make these movements in a regular, persistent, ordered and a neat way, it is the way to make your body strong and beautiful. As by means of this physical discipline you secure a strong and beautiful body, even so by the inner discipline, by controlling your passions and impulsions you build an inner body strong and beautiful. Yes, even like a physical body you have a subtle body, a body as it were within this material frame. It is not, however, for that reason, something vague and imprecise, on the contrary, it is very concrete and has a definite shape. As I said, by controlled and directed movements you make this outer body strong and beautiful; the inner body also in the same way through controlled and directed inner movements can be made strong and beautiful. In properly doing the physical exercises, you know, two things are needed: first of all, doing the physical movements according to the rules, in other words, exercising the muscles in a given manner, and then along with it relaxation. Relaxation and excercise should alternate. Relaxation restores the muscles, brings repose to the system and serves as a kind of basic support. In the field of the inner discipline, this relaxation corresponds to what I have called freedom. And the muscular exercises correspond to the excercise of your will and consciousness in regard to the inner body.

The building up of the inner beautiful body has a great influence upon the building of the physical body, it adds something, it gives a feeling of inherent capacity, firmness and charm even to the physical frame.

Many find it difficult at the outset to make the right movement even in the matter of physical exercises. What is n6eded is will and persistence. More difficult, much more difficult it is to make the right inner movement, there also what is needed is will and persistence. Sometimes in the matter of inner discipline which means doing the right thing, you say, \"If I know the right thing to do, then I can do it; to do the right thing I must know the right thing. If I do not know the right thing, how can I do it?\" In the same way many exclaim: \"How to find God, how to see God? I do not know what God is. Then how can I try to find Him?\" They say: \"First you must see God, then you can believe.\" In fact this is not true. The truth is the other way round. The Mother says, \"If you are sincere, absolutely sincere and you take the resolution that you will do the right thing whatever happens, then surely the right thing will reveal itself to you.\" But the basic condition is that. Your resolve must be there, to do the right whenever it presents itself to you whatever the cost.Indeed you are not, a human being is not so obscure and inert as the appearance shows. There is a soul in everyone, there is a light within you which always points to the right. Only you are absent-minded, you do not care to look around and be on the alert. If you care, truly want to see the light, you will see it there before you. You must be ready to recognise it. It all depends upon your will, your good will, your inner sincerity. The inner sincerity will show you your path, the next step you are to take and you will know more and more as you advance. But if you hesitate, if you have in the background of your mind as it usually happens, the feeling that even if you see the right thing you may not do it, you may not be prepared to face too much difficulty or opposition in the execution. The very wavering thought that you may not do it will obscure your path and the light will not be there. You have to believe, believe blindly, for you know what you believe in is not anything wrong or mistaken, for your urge is to welcome the truth, a sincere readiness to welcome the truth when it comes, this will bring forward the truth and if you proceed, proceed in this way, welcoming the light every time it comes, disregarding all other pulls and distractions, your welcoming becomes easier and warmer and the light grows brighter and brighter. By your faith and trust you increase the power of your discrimination, increase the force of your character, increase the influence of a growing light upon your nature and your inner being; your true person in you grows in stature, grows in strength and beauty.

In this path there is another line for growth and development which is of considerable importance as you will see. You are here or for that matter anywhere in society-not alone but you live together with others. You study together, play together, work together. You have friends, comrades, companions, you are in a group, in a company. Now it is of great importance to have the right company, you must have good companions, good comrades, good friends. That will help you in ways more than one. In this connection I can do nothing better than just to read out what the Mother says on the subject. She says: usually in your ignorance and simplicity, foolish simplicity, you choose convenient friends, that is to say, those who praise you, flatter you, who do not contradict you even if you go the wrong way, even they encourage you in doing the wrong thing in order to be friendly with you. Such friends are dangerous, dangerous to yourself and dangerous to your so-called friends too. Here is the text of the Mother's words:

*C'est cela qui doit être à la base de l'attitude que l'on est en droit d'attendre d'un véritable ami: il ne doit pas vouloir que vous lui ressembliez, mais que vous soyez, au contraire, tel que vous êtes.*
*Et j’avais écrit: \"Notre meilleur ami est celui qui nous aime dans le meilleur de nous-mêmes.\" D'une façon un peu plus positive, je dirai: celui qui vous encourage à descendre au niveau le plus bas de vous-même, qui vous pousse à faire des sottises avec lui, ou à devenir vicieux avec lui, ou qui vous approuve dans tout ce que vous avez de vilain, celui-là n' est pas votre ami. Et pourtant, trés souvent, beaucoup trap souvent, on fait son ami de celui avec lequel on n' est pas gêné quand on est au-dessous de soi-même. On s’associe avec ceux qui courent au lieu d’aller à l’école et qui vane voter des fruits dans les jardins, avec ceux qui se moquent de leurs pro-fesseurs et qui font toutes sortes de chases vilaines; c’est pourquoi j’ai dit: \"Ceux-là ne sane pas vas bans amis.\" Mais enfin, ce sane les amis les plus confortables, payee qu’ils ne vous donnent jamais l'mpression que vous êtes en faute. Tandis qu’à celui qui viendrait vous dire: \"Dis done, au lieu d' alley courir, à ne rien faire, ou a faire des bêtises, si tu venais en classe, tu crois que ce ne strait pas mieux?\" – à celui-là, généralement, on répond: \"Tu m’embêtes, tu n'es pasmon ami.*\"

*.... Il faut considérer comme son meilleur ami celui qui se refuse à participer à une action mauvaise ou laide, celui qui vous encourage à resister aux tentations inférieures; celui-là, c' est l' ami.*

*C'est avec lui qu’il faut vous associer et non avec celui qui fortifie vos mauvais penchants et participe à vos mauvaises actions.*[^11]

\"That should be the basis of the attitude which one has the right to expect from a true friend: he must not wish that you should be like him, but that you should be on the contrary, what you are.

And I wrote, \"Our best friend is he who loves us in our best part.\" In a more positive way, I would say: he who encourages you to descend to the lowest level in you, who drives you to do stupid things with him or become vicious along with him or approves all that is vile in you is not your friend. And yet, very often, much too often, you make a friend of him with whom you do not feel uneasy when you are below your own self. You associate with those who run about instead of going to school, who would steal fruits from gardens, those who poke fun at their teachers and who do all sorts of nasty things. That is why I said, \"Such people are not your good friends\". But they are the friends who are very comfortable, because they never give you the impression that you are in the wrong. Whereas if one comes and tells you, \"I say, instead of roaming about doing nothing or doing stupid things, why not go to your class, don't you think it would be better?\" To such a person you would generally reply, \"you are troublesome, you are not my friend.\"  One should regard him only as his best friend who refuses to take part in a bad or ugly act, who encourages you to resist all lower temptations. He is indeed your friend.

 It is with him that you should associate and not with one who strengthens your bad propensities and takes part in your bad actions.\" 

 And the Mother adds:

 >*Au fond, on ne devrait prendre pour amis que des gens plus sages que soi-même, des gens done la compagnie vous ennoblit et vous aide à vous surmonter, à progresser, à agir mieux et à voir plus clair. Et finalement, le meilleur ami que l'on puisse avoir, n'est-ce point le Divin? le Divin à qui l'on peut tout dire, tout révéler, payee que c’est la qu’est la source de toute miséricorde, de tout pouvoir d' effacer l'erreur quand elle ne se reproduit plus, qui peut ouvrir la route vers la realisation veritable; le Divin qui peut tout com prendre, tout guérir, qui vous aide sur le chemin à ne pas faiblir, ne pas broncher, ne pas tomber et qui vous méne tout droit au but. C' est Lui, l' ami vrai, l' ami des bans et des mauvais jours, celui qui ne fait jamais défaut. Quand on l'appelle sincèrement, Il est toujours là pour vous guider, pour vous soutenir et pour vous aimer de la vraie façon.*[^12]

 So you see, the best friend that you can have, the Mother says, is the Divine Himself, that is to say, the Mother Herself. You can find no other friend so friendly, so loving and so lovable. Do not think she is too great for you, she is very far and you are very small. It is not true. She can be, she can make herself as small as yourself to be with you: because she is you.

 I will tell you here a personal story. When we were together with Sri Aurobindo, long long ago, we were almost as young as you are, not quite though, only a few years older: we had then like you, infinite freedom, we did almost whatever we liked, went wherever it pleased us to go, we did not care much for food or dress or luxuries but we liked pleasant picnics, and along with that of course a little bit of study: but studying not any imposed lessons, studying whatever we liked, whatever we chose to read. Then one day, years after, Sri Aurobindo told us-we were at that time only four or five in number-he told us, somewhat seriously, he was seldom serious or grave with us, he had always his smile – \“You have so forgotten yourselves, you do not think even of what you have come here for (because we had all left our family, even our country and all worldly considerations); to be with you, to be one of you, I have made myself very small, I have cut myself so to say to your size to walk with you, to be on the same level. Even then you cannot follow, I seem to be still too far from you. That won't do. Now you must try to run and come up to me. I cannot make myself still smaller. I have made myself sufficiently small.\"

  I may remind you here of what Sri Krishna did in this line, something very similar. Sri Krishna, the Divine, became a very ordinary playmate of cowherd-boys and village maids and was one of them and with them, almost with no apparent difference. The Divine not merely as the Master, the Guru, the leader or the captain but as a loving playmate and comrade is a very extraordinary Indian conception of the Divine. Arjuna in his loving tenderness for his friend Krishna almost forgot to respect him and. honour him, he could only embrace him. But one day revelation came to him as to who his intimate friend and comrade really was: he was dumbfounded and full of contrition and repentance for his past lapses. I may tell you Arjuna's state of mind in his own words – as stated in the Gita:

  >For whatsoever I have spoken to Thee in rash vehemence, thinking of Thee only as my human friend and companion, 'O Krishna, O Yadava, O Comrade,' not knowing this Thy greatness, in negligent error or in love, and for whatsoever disrespect was shown by me to Thee in jest, at play, on the couch and the seat and in the banquet, alone or in Thy presence, O faultless One, I pray forgiveness from Thee, the Immeasurable.[^13]

  However what I wanted to say is, the Mother is truly your mother and as truly your friend and comrade. She loves you as no one else can love. She answers to your love as no one else can. And she teaches you how to love. Even if you are full of errors and mistakes; it does not matter, she takes you as you are, you can be quite free and open to her, she is there to understand you, to help you. She is not there to scold you or find fault with or criticise you. If you are not able to correct yourself, you have simply to look to her, she will do what is needful for you. I have always spoken to you of a body beautiful, an inner body beautiful and an outer body beautiful – any wrong thought or feeling or act leaves a stain, a scar upon your inner body, you are to see that the stain goes away and the body resume its glow, you are not always able to do it with your own will and effort because you do not know how to do it, but only try not to repeat the error and take your shelter in the Mother's presence, in her arms. The stain disfigures your inner beauty, you have to pray and appeal to her: with her healing touch she will remove all stain and disfiguring mark. It is an experience that some of you must have had in some way or other, must have felt in dream at least, the loving embrace of the Mother. You have to live in it, live it even in your waking hours. Be sincere and ask for it, your wish will be granted. 

[^11]:Bulletin of *Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education,* August 1961, pp. 38-41.

[^12]:\"In reality, you should take as friends only those persons who are wiser than you, whose company ennobles you, helps you to transcend yourself, to progress, to act better and see clearer. And finally, the best friend that one can have, is it not the Divine? the Divine to whom one can say everything, disclose everything, because here is the source of all kindness, of the power that effaces every error when it is no longer repeated, which can open the path to the true realisation; the Divine who can understand everything, cure everything, who helps you on the way not to waver, not to falter, not to fall down and who leads you straight the goal. He is the true friend, the friend in good and bad days, who never ails you. When you call him sincerely, he is always there to guide you, to sustain you and love you in the true way.\" – O p. cit.

"IN its early days, quite at the beginning, we may now say, long long ago, for it is now almost half a century ago, the Ashram from its very start and quite spontaneously and inevitably grew into a community life. That is to say, the individuals ceased to have any personal possessions. Whatever they had belonged not to themselves but to the group, rather to the Master of the group, the Guru, to the Mother and Sri Aurobindo. Whatever they had, they considered as having received from the Mother for use only. They are not proprietors or possessors of anything: whatever they needed or they thought they needed, they had to ask for it and the Mother decided what they should have or not. It was a joyous surrender of possessions and a grateful acceptance of gifts. One may yet remember the beautiful movement that impelled each one of those who were fortunate to be there at that time. One is reminded of a parallel movement, although on a different field, described by Tagore in his well-known lines:
