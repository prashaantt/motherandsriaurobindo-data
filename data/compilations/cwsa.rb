  desc: "To commemorate Sri Aurobindo's 125th birth anniversary in 1997, the Sri Aurobindo Ashram is bringing out The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo in a uniform library edition of 37 volumes.

The set will contain all works published thus far as well as some still unpublished writings. It will include around 3000 pages of texts which did not form part of the earlier 30-volume Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library.

The Complete Works will include the following new material:

- a volume of Vedic and linguistic writings, Vedic Studies with Writings on Philology.
- commentaries on the major Upanishads, especially the Isha. This material is placed in two volumes, Isha Upanishad and Kena and Other Upanishads.
- two volumes of Sri Aurobindo's spiritual journal, Record of Yoga, the diary of his sadhana between 1909 and 1927; with a glossary.
- about 300 pages of writings on philosophy and yoga, not published during Sri Aurobindo's lifetime. This material appears in Essays Divine and Human.
- new letters on yoga
- new autobiographical writings

The texts of The Complete Works are being checked against all available manuscripts and earlier editions to ensure their accuracy."
