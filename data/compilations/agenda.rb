  desc: "This tremendous document--6,000 pages in 13 volumes--is the day-to-day account over twenty-two years of Mother's exploration into the body consciousness and of her discovery of a \"cellular mind\" capable of restructuring the nature of the body and the laws of the species as drastically as one day the first stammerings of a \"thinking mind\" transformed the nature of the ape. It is a veritable document of experimental evolution. A revolution in consciousness that alters the laws of the species. And it's the question of our times, for whatever the appearances, we are not at the end of a civilization but at the end of an evolutionary cycle. Are we going to find the passage to the next species... or perish? As scrupulously as a scientist in his laboratory, Mother goes back to the origin of matter's formation, to the primordial code, and there, \"by chance,\" stumbles upon the mechanism of death--upon the very power that changes death--and upon a \"new\" Energy which curiously parallels the most recent theories on the subatomic nature of Matter. The key to Matter contains the key to death ... and the key to the next species."
