>“We mean by the Absolute something greater than ourselves, greater than the cosmos which we live in, the supreme reality of that transcendent Being which we call God, something without which all that we see or are conscious of as existing, could not have been, could not for a moment remain in existence. Indian thought calls it Brahman, European thought the Absolute because it is a self-existent which is absolved of all bondage to relativities . . . The Absolute is for us the Ineffable.”

Out of these seed-sounds develop a small number of primitive root-words with an immense progeny which have their successive generations and arrange themselves in tribes, clans, families, selective groups each having a common stock and a common psychological history. For the factor which presided over the development of language was the association, by the nervous mind of primitive man, of certain general significances or rather of certain general utilities and sense-values with articulate sounds. The process of this association was also in no sense artificial but natural, governed by simple and definite psychological laws.”

It is therefore a power that has proceeded from the Overmind, -- but with the Supermind as its ulterior origin, -- as all these greater powers have proceeded: but its special character, its activity of consciousness are dominated by Thought; it is a luminous thought-mind, a mind of Spirit-born conceptual knowledge.

The 353 articles published here have been ascribed to Sri Aurobindo by the editors for a variety of reasons.

Details on the materials and methodology of the selection are given in the Note on the Texts.\r\n\r\nThese volumes also include political articles written by Sri Aurobindo before the start of the *Bande Mataram*, speeches delivered by him between 1907 and 1908, articles from manuscripts of that period that he did not publish during his lifetime, and an interview of 1908. Many of these writings were not prepared by Sri Aurobindo for publication; several were left in an unfinished state.

Formed in the French Cartesian mould, a freedom fighter against the Nazis during the Second World War, and in love with his freedom, he was always ready to run away, yet always coming back, drawn by a love greater than his love for freedom. Being with Mother was, in his own words, like \"struggling with the jungle, machete in hand - ultimately to melt, to fall in love, so beautiful it is... It was fascinating and detestable, overpowering and warm. One felt like screaming and biting, and running away, but always returning.\" Slowly she conquered him, slowly he came to understand the poignant drama of this lone indomitable woman struggling to unseal man's evolutionary future, to open the door to a new species after man.

Between then and February 1910, when he left Calcutta, he edited this journal, writing most of its contents himself. In addition to articles on political and related matters, the *Karmayogin* contained essays on philosophy, yoga, education, art and literature, as well as translations and poetry. The political articles are published in this volume, the other items are listed at the end of the *Karmayogin* issue they appeared in. A table at the end of the volume shows where these other items are published in THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SRI AUROBINDO.\r\n\r\nSri Aurobindo delivered a number of speeches between May and October 1909. Texts of some of them were published in the *Karmayogin* and other journals. Others were preserved only in notes jotted down by police agents. The speeches are published in this volume according to date of delivery and not of publication.\r\n\r\nSome of the articles included in this volume were published in booklets brought out between 1918 and 1923 and later reprinted. When a revised edition of one of these booklets was published in 1937, a disciple of Sri Aurobindo’s wrote a review of it that he sent to Sri Aurobindo for approval. Sri Aurobindo’s response gives some idea of his attitude at that time towards his earlier writings:\r\n\r\n\u003EYes, I have seen it [the disciple’s review], but I don’t think it can be published in its present form as it prolongs the political Aurobindo of that time into the Sri Aurobindo of the present time. You even assert that I have “thoroughly” revised the book and these articles are an index of my latest views on the burning problems of the day and there has been no change in my views in 27 years (which would surely be proof [of] a rather unprogressive mind). How do you get all that? My spiritual consciousness and knowledge at that time was as nothing to what it is now — how would the change leave my view of politics and life unmodified altogether? There has been no such thorough revision; I have left the book as it was, because it would be useless to modify what was written so long ago — the same as with Yoga and its objects [*The Yoga and Its Objects*]. Anyway the review would almost amount to a proclamation of my present political views — while on the contrary I have been careful to pronounce nothing — no views whatever on political questions for the last I don’t know how many years.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the contents of the present volume was first published in book-form in 1972 as *Karmayogin: Early Political Writings — II*, volume 2 of the Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library. The text of the present edition, the first with the title *Karmayogin: Political Writings and Speeches 1909–1910*, has been checked against the *Karmayogin* journal and the sources of the speeches and revised articles.", subtitle: "Political Writings and Speeches 1909-1910"},

The four essays on Indian art appeared as *The Significance of Indian Art* and the four essays on Indian polity as *The Spirit and Form of Indian Polity*. The rest of the series was only sporadically revised. When its publication was proposed to him in 1949, Sri Aurobindo replied:\r\n\r\n\u003EThe Defence of Indian Culture is an unfinished book and also I had intended to alter much of it and to omit all but brief references to William Archer’s criticisms. That was why its publication has been so long delayed. Even if it is reprinted as it is considerable alterations will have to be made and there must be some completion and an end to the book which does not at present exist.\r\n\r\nThe desired alterations were never made.\r\n\r\nThe text of the present edition has been checked against the *Arya* and the revised versions.\r\n\r\nA number of photographic reproductions of Indian architecture, sculpture and painting have been included to illustrate references in the text.", subtitle: "And Other Essays on Indian Culture"}
